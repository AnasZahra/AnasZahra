### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Anas based in Germany, I started learning programming in the end of 2021 in my collage https://www.htwsaar.de/. I really enjoy working on my Desk, learning new stuff about programming, as well as designing.

I got a pretty good experience in UI/UX, so I wanted to start putting it in use, in learning Software development in both front and back end.
