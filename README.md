### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anas, based in Germany. I began my programming journey at the end of 2021 while studying at htwsaar. I have a passion for working at my desk, continuously learning new programming skills, and diving into design.

With a strong background in UI/UX, I've been channeling this experience into my software development journey, focusing on both front-end and back-end development.
