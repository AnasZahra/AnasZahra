### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Anas from Syria living in Germany, I started learning programming in the end of 2021 in my collage https://www.htwsaar.de/. I really enjoy working on my Desk, learning new stuff about programming, as well as designing.
Not only that, but I started designing in 2017 www.behance.net/anc22, and I got a pretty good experience in these years, so I wanted to start putting it in use, in learning web development in both front and back end.
